        Today's blog was about something regarding other things.
        It was particularily interesting because there was the one thing
        that happened, and then that other event occured. This is gumbly
        gook that I am typing to fill out the section so see if it makes
        sense as a synopsis format.

        Open this to watch how the wonderful world of HTML takes you to
        yet anoher page! This page will most likely be empty for now,
        but it is fun to continue practicing adding URLs to my python
        webapp.
